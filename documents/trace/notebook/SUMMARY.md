# TRACE Modelling Notebook for the IRIS model

This is the Modelling Notebook for the [IRIS model](https://git.ufz.de/ecoepi/iris) developed by [EcoEpi](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=36552). 
It is based on the TRACE documentation framework ([Grimm et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.01.018)) and follows the proposed structure of
[Ayllón et al (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104932).

The aim of this modelling notebook is to track the iterative model development process through regular notes on current activities related to the IRIS
modelling project, thereby creating transparency as with laboratory notebooks in other scientific disciplines. This should enable better and more efficient
model design (including testing and analysis), as well as increased model acceptance and reuse through reproducibility of the model itself and its simulation
experiments.

This modelling notebook was created on 27 January 2021. Entries prior to this date were added based on existing handwritten notes, entries from the 
IRIS Trello board, the IRIS project wiki, the commit history of the IRIS GitLab repository and discussions with involved colleagues. Since not every day can be
reproduced exactly, some entries summarise several days of modelling work.
